/**
 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
 * <p>
 * Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
 * <p>
 * Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
 * <p>
 * class Node {
 * public int val;
 * public List<Node> neighbors;
 * }
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Test case format:
 * <p>
 * For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
 * <p>
 * An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
 * <p>
 * The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 * Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
 * Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
 * 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
 * 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
 * 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
 * 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: adjList = [[]]
 * Output: [[]]
 * Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: adjList = []
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
 * 1 <= Node.val <= 100
 * Node.val is unique for each node.
 * There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
 * The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
